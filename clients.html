                                                            We wanted to steer away from any traditional approaches to

                                                            Rather than filming in a standard studio setting, we filmed
                                                            with
                                                            three cancer patients in a female-focussed sex shop
                                                            showing them exploring, having fun, and being at ease with
                                                            the
                                                            subject of female pleasure. This informal approach in

                                                            also

                                                            professionals are understandably strained from high

                                                            five seconds would be critical to grabbing their attention -

                                                            we decided to open the film with dildos smashing through

                                                            and co-directors, in order to avoid the non-disabled gaze
                                                            onto a
                                                            group of disabled artists. The film was then screened
                                                            at the Tate Modern, as part of an event around art and
                                                            access,
                                                            which was the perfect audience and setting to showcase
                                                            the film.
