                                                            We wanted to steer away from any traditional approaches to

                                                            Rather than filming in a standard studio setting, we filmed
                                                            with
                                                            three cancer patients in a female-focussed sex shop
                                                            showing them exploring, having fun, and being at ease with
                                                            the
                                                            subject of female pleasure. This informal approach in
                                                            turn helped them relax around us, around each other, and
                                                            also

                                                            professionals are understandably strained from high

                                                            five seconds would be critical to grabbing their attention -

                                                            we decided to open the film with dildos smashing through
                                                            the frame. What could be a more attention-grabbing opening

                                                            to film, and what needed to be rethought or adjusted. For

                                                        <p>We were approached by filmmaker Ella Glendining and CRIPtic
                                                            Arts
                                                            founder Jamie Hale to manage the production of Call Us
                                                            CRIPtic. An Arts Council funded project, which would use
                                                            documentary to look at emerging disabled artists involved in
                                                            CRIPtic and the ways in which ableism impact their work and
                                                            career. We learnt so much from this project about how to
                                                            create a genuinely accessible and inclusive set for crew,
                                                            cast
                                                            and contributors, particularly around disability. The
                                                            creative approach was to allow the artists to completely
                                                            voice
                                                            the film and story in their own words, as well as to play
                                                            on the dramatic visual setting of theatre, performing, and
                                                            being
                                                            backstage. It was also essential to have disabled crew
                                                            and co-directors, in order to avoid the non-disabled gaze
                                                            onto a
                                                            group of disabled artists. The film was then screened
                                                            at the Tate Modern, as part of an event around art and
                                                            access,
                                                            which was the perfect audience and setting to showcase
                                                            the film.
