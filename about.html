              Fig Films is named after a cat.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg about-text">
              Both Jessi and Holly are obsessed with cats; especially their own rescue cats Fig (Holly’s) and Wesley
              (Jessi’s). Wesley Films didn’t quite flow so Fig became the leading contender. But once we started looking
              into figs, it transpired that the name was even more apt for this production company than we had first
              realised. The fig fruit has a remarkable and symbolic history. In Greek and Italian, the word for ‘fig’
              evolved to mean ‘vulva’. In Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar, the fig tree becomes iconic for the protagonist
              Esther’s inner turmoil, as a young woman torn between the different wishes and desires she feels and
              society tells her to feel.
            </p>
            <p class="lh-lg about-text">
              In a serendipitous way, the fig became a symbol for us and the kind of films we want to make. We want to
              represent and join others in a new wave of feminine filmmaking which is intersectional; where power, ego
              and hierarchy are replaced with respect, humility and equality. We believe a lens is a powerful tool that
              has the potential to help heal and empower the people it focuses on. Rather than pander to patronising
              claims of ‘giving voice to the voiceless’, we want to collaborate in partnership with historically
              marginalised
              people and grow Fig Films to be representative of those communities. We’ve created a manifesto which
              explains our ethos and goals further - that you can read <a class="link-light"

              As well as making independent films, we make creative content for charities and ethical organisations.

          <p class="lh-lg about-text">
            A documentary director at heart who has recently discovered a love/hate relationship with producing and
            writing authentic narrative stories. She is particularly passionate about the hybrid and experimental
            documentary
            form and making films about the climate crisis that aren’t issue-based. Her short films have screened at
            BAFTA qualifying festivals including Edinburgh International Film Festival, BFI Flare and Aesthetica Short
            Film

            Holly has over seven years experience shooting, producing and directing creative award-winning documentary,
            charity and
            branded projects. Her debut documentary The Home for Broken Toys was an immediate success, screening at
            festivals
            worldwide and winning multiple awards. In 2022, she produced and directed British Red Cross’ most successful
            DRTV advert
            which directly fundraised over £1m for the Ukraine Crisis Appeal.
          </p>
          <p class="lh-lg about-text">
            She is an accomplished self-shooter who specialises in filming in complex global environments - most
            recently Syria and
            Bangladesh. Often navigating highly sensitive topics (such as human trafficking and chronic loneliness),
            Holly produces
            intimate cuts that delicately observe, challenge and uplift. She treats philosophical or existential themes
            through a
            visually creative lens, and seeks wherever possible to find lightness, humour and hope in the dark.
          </p>
          <p class="lh-lg about-text">
            Her MA in Ethnographic & Documentary Filmmaking (with UCL’s prestigious Open City Docs) provided the
            grounding for her
            rigorous ethical approach and co-production filmmaking practices today, and she has since returned to
            co-teach
            anthropology undergraduates on the ethics of filmmaking. She is especially passionate about exploring issues
            with and
            through the eyes of the individuals/groups affected by them. This collective opportunity to find out what it
            means to be
            human, what makes us connect, and how we can work together to make the world a kinder, brighter place forms
            the
            heartbeat of her work.
